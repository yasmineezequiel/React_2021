// What is a component

// Components are building blocks of ui such as navigation bar, footer, list of items, filter, form, etc..
// How is a component built: html, js and css

// Why components?
// 1. Reusability (DRY)
// 2.Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions
// 3.Easier to debug
