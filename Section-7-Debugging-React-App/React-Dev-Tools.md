# Apart from traditional ways of debugging react app such as following the UI flow/functions, checking the console and using breakpoints(source) there is another way of debugging React App: React dev tools, https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html

How to access React dev tools:

1. download the browser extension:
   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en

2. In the localhost, inspect the app and go to "Components" where you can see all props, hooks and functions of each component and how it flows with the UI.
